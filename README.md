# Advent of Code

This year I will tackle the advent of code problems in Python. I am using built-in python and other related libraries.
I am not going for the most efficient solution, benchmarking my code, nor timing my solutions. I am just solving these
problems for fun. Considering finals week is in December, I will not be able to solve these problems on the day they are
released, nor will I be able to solve them all.

## Running the code

To run the code, you will need to have Python 3 installed. Create a venv and all that jazz. Replace the 'input.txt' file
with the input file for the problem you are trying to solve. Then run the code with `python3 d<n>.d<n>.py`.
Replace `<n>`
with the day number.
